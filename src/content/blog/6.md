### Initial material testing

I started out by testing lighting effects of different materials. I was choosing between white PLA, clear PETG and PLA wood.

I printed all of them with a 0.6 nozzle, as recommended in online forums. As expected, the clear PETG didn’t end up so clear.

#### Clear PETG woes

Printing clear / translucent was as complicated as I expected. I followed these [tutorials](https://makerworld.com/en/models/38421?from=search#profileId-37238)
and was able to get something closer to clear. The tradeoff was how long it took to print these - even though I did use the 0.6 nozzle, these small ice cube samples took over 3 hours to print.

Factors affecting clear PETG print:

1. Slicer settings (fan, print speed, nozzle)
2. PETG quality
3. Bed plate material (textured PEI gave a more frosty look vs. the smooth PEI plate)
4. Time

Even though I was able to get some prints closer to clear, I realized for the tight deadline it wouldn’t be a top priority material given how long it takes to print and how many mistakes I probably would make.

#### Testing lighting effects

After printing out a few samples of material (frosty PETG, 1mm thin white PLA, 2mm thin white PLA), I tested how it might look layered together and on it’ own with my light source. At the beginning of my project, I set out to make a garlic lamp but realized I wanted to concentrate on lighting effect vs. form factor for the lamp (which is why I probably shouldn’t do so much planning for future projects - almost always I never follow the detailed plan).

(It’s in this video I’m reminded I have no space left for another desk lamp and pushed me to consider a wall mounted lamp)

#### Prototype 1 (Desk Lamp)

I used [this template](https://www.printables.com/model/724204-lamp-base/files) from printables as a lamp holder, and ended up going back and forth between designs (big mistake). I wasn’t very happy with the standing lamp setup, but it at least fulfilled the lamp requirement for this assignment without fasteners.

#### Prototype 2 (Wall Lamp)

##### Iteration 1

A lamp I actually need is a bedside lamp. After seeing how the light diffused on the desk lamp setup, I decided to give a wall lamp a go.
I used [this simple wall lamp mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2138676) from thingiverse that I ended up remixing. I was also facing issues with the small size of my printer, and it did become a huge limitation I had to design around. Since I couldn’t decide what kind of cover I wanted to do, I decided to make the cover interchangeable / replaceable so I could make different versions of the lamp shade in different shapes and materials.

##### Iteration 2

I printed out a modified version of the wall mount with a snap-fit attachment. Initially I thought it might be useful to make things removable etc., but I realized for this lamp, it doesn’t have to be entirely modular.

##### Iteration 3

I decided to use 3m double sided tape to mount to the wall, when I realized that it probably counts as a “fastener” which we weren’t supposed to use for this assignment. I figured since the first lamp passed the test, I could just do what I wanted with this second prototype. The lamp technically isn’t held together by the double sided tape, it’s just used to mount on the wall.

#### Takeaways

1. Clear PETG is a pain, I would only use it if I had multiple printers at the ready.
2. Don’t reinvent the wheel - one of the things I did right from the get go was using someone else’s stl file and building on that. Why make things harder when more prototyping can be done in a shorter amount of time?
3. Pinterest is a great place to get ideas from, but I won’t be looking at Pinterest anymore if I’m using a material I haven’t worked with before. Focusing on form can make the perfectionist itch take over.
4. Don’t plan too much! I got too caught up trying to execute what I had in mind. I realized I prefer to go straight into making things with a general design idea and just tweaking it through multiple iterations.
