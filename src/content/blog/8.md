I have really small hands and have developed bad wrist pain over recent years despite trying to fix my posture, setup etc. Most mechanical keyboards aren’t really designed for smaller hand sizes like mine. I felt the most pain in-between my pinky and ring finger, which I found was because of how far key travel is. This is what got me into the keyboard hobby, unfortunately.

#### My first keyboard

My first keyboard was a ducky shine ii (a very old keyboard!) with a full 108 key layout. This is the keyboard that got me into the hobby and interest in testing out different layouts, switches, and switch weights.

#### My current keyboard

This is my current keyboard! It looks goofy but it’s probably one of the things I’d save if my house caught on fire. It’s actually made to my hand size, it’s 3d printed resin and one of the reasons I’m in this class!

(Boba u4t silent switches + DSA keycaps)

Unfortunately… I can only use it at home. The material isn’t as sturdy as other easily purchased keyboards, so I really don’t want to transport this around. So… I decided for my final project to create a portable ergo keyboard!

### My requirements

1. It should “portable”
2. Wired
3. Ergo
4. Sturdy enough to bring around

### Inspiration

#### Elora

I was going to buy this keyboard to take around, but like most great keyboards…

Not only is on pre-order but you also have to purchase a preorder ticket to preorder and even then receiving it isn’t guaranteed.

#### So…. DIY?

At first, I was contemplating buying one of the PCBs of kyria v1 (one of their older keyboards) but I came across this video:

![“The REAL Ergonomic Keyboard Endgame!” - How To Design & Make A Totally Custom Keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKfeJrRIcxw)

The creator used an open-source package called [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz/) to generate their own keyvboard layout. The output files also generate a PCB file you can open in KiCad to finish routing then send out to have manufactured.

MY GOAL: is to have a keyboard assembled for a final project. This does not include being operationally useful (with qmk/zmk), or very nice looking design wise. Assembly is my main goal, everything else is just a bonus. I want to concentrate on the experience of building something like this keyboard and not so much the aesthetic (yet).

#### Designing with Ergogen

![Screenshot_2024-05-15_at_5.32.57_PM_kc8dor](https://res.cloudinary.com/digifab/image/upload/v1715819601/digital-fab/a8/Screenshot_2024-05-15_at_5.32.57_PM_kc8dor.png)

So far, I’ve iterated over the shape I want and decided what specs I want my keyboard to have.

I’m in the process of routing left and right hands in KiCad. I plan to use this[freerouting/freerouting: Advanced PCB auto-router](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting) to route my design before sending off the order to PCBway tonight.

Specs:

1. Choc switch compatibility
2. Split keyboard
3. Wired
   Stretch Goals:
4. OLED screen
5. Functioning with key mapping
6. Carrying case

Things to do:

- [x] Decide minimum acceptable specs for keyboard
- [x] Iterate over different board shapes and decide which shape is most comfortable for my hands
- [ ] Learn / use ergogen to generate output file
- [ ] Route left hand in KiCad
- [ ] Route right hand in KiCad
- [ ] Send to manufacturer
- [ ] Purchase materials
- [ ] Iterate over case designs with laser cutting and 3d printing
- [ ] Solder switches and mcu to PCB
- [ ] Assemble cases
- [ ] Write documentation

#### Bill of materials

- Choc switches - ordered
- mcu - deciding which one to get
- soldering materials (in-stock)
- keycaps - _ maybe 3d printing this _
- trrs cable (connect two keyboard halves)
- usb c cable (in stock)

### 533 Requirements: At least 4 of below:

==Laser cutting==
==Rhino== (KiCad)
Grasshopper
CNC milling
==3D printing==
Interference fits (press-fit)
==Incorporating stock parts==
Mold design
