#### Design

I had never done laser cutting or 3d modelling in rhino before, so I decided that I wanted to design something that was a simple shape, and something circular. I had multiple ideas I wanted to try, but decided to go with a butterfly-like shape.

#### Model

The model took a bit of time to make even though it was a very simple shape, because I decided to use Rhino. I figured I'd have to use it eventually, so a large part of this assignment was watching educational videos. I'm happy with what I've come up with, but I do want to figure out how to add chamfers to my designs. I looked up some <cite>beginner laser cutting tips[^1]</cite>, and found that the laser is a non-zero measurement, so I did remove 0.15 mm from the size of the cardboard.

#### Laser cutting

I found some old amazon boxes, and did my first laser cut at the mill. I decided to just go for it (which was not smart) and print all 30 of my pieces, and luckily the measurements matched up! I think accoutning for the size of the laser really paid off, and I'm glad that I did it. There were some things I did not expect though:

1. Don't cut small shapes on folded parts of the cardboard box. I had some shapes that were lasercut on the fold, and some of them split in half.
2. Using thinner cardboard is easier, because it cuts through completely on the first try

#### Measurements:

```markdown
- Cardboard: 2.5mm
- Shape size: 3x4"
- Slot size: 2.35mm
- Settings: P (50%) F(50%) S(20%)
```

#### Shake test

Overall, a success!
