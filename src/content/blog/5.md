## Part 1

### Requirements:

1. Modify mesh of 2 stls
2. Pass rapid prototyping checks in rhino

### STLs

I decided to do something random and have a frog on a dumpling. Initially, I only had 1 frog on a dumpling, but I later added a lily pad and another frog because why not.

Files / Sources:
[Frog](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5161049)
[Dumpling](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2810702)
[Lily pad](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5405025)

### Rhino

Steps:

1. Insert stl downloaded
2. Select object, convert to mesh
3. Delete original shape
4. Select object, points on
5. Edit > control points > connected
6. Right click until area is generally selected, then transform / modify mesh area
7. Once finished, group everything
8. Repeat steps 1-7 with the rest of the objects
9. Place objects on dumpling, trim the dumpling top by a few mm using a box and BooleanMeshDifference
10. Place frogs on dumpling and BooleanMeshDifference once more
11. Add lily pad
12. MeshEdges to check that everything is connected
13. Run mesh repair
14. Export to slicer

For my mesh, I decided to try and change the mouth angle and the arm angle for one of the frogs.

### Printing

##### First Print

I printed a miniature sized one first to see if it would come out all in one piece. In the previous assignment, I ignored the warnings on the slicer that I had non manifold edges and just hoped it would work, and it turned out that I had edges / surfaces that weren’t totally capped or connecting.

##### Second Print

Unfortunately I ran out of filament while printing the bigger size.

#### Third Print

Had to wait for my Amazon order to arrive. I’m pretty happy with the filament I bought (Overture and Hatchbox), and I find that it’s much nicer than the one sold at the Mill, and it’s cheaper.

Measurements and Print setings
- Standard Print
- Scaled 80%
- 0.2mm nozzle
```

## Part 2

### Requirements

1. Make a lamp that doesn’t require any fasteners
2. Use techniques we’ve learned in class previously
3. Should be usable (not fall apart easily)

### Planning

#### Bill of Materials

(So far so good!)

- [ ] Pliers for removing supports
- [ ] Isopropyl Alcohol
- [x] PETG (transparent)
- [x] PLA (wood finish)
- [x] Lamp connector (from class list)
- [x] Bulb (using old smart bulb)

#### Design Progress

Inspiration:
My favorite cooking ingredient (garlic). Had this idea while making garlic confit.

Elements I want to keep:
| | How |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Warm diffused color of garlic | Use material that will make light diffuse evenly and softly (bought transparent PETG for this) |
| Natural curves / shape of the garlic cross section | find a pattern in a similar shape, extrude it by a few cm, overlay on a surface and create points of attachment |

Ideally, the lamp would have two attachments, one for the diffuse layer and one for the structure layer that will highlight the shape of each piece.

#### CAD Progress

In progress! I wanted to test out my material before getting very serious with the modelling.

#### Printing Progress

I ran out of filament as I was doing the assignment and the materials just arrived today. I was planning on testing how the translucent PETG diffuses light before class, but unfortunately the delivery came late.
